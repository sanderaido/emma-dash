Learning analytics dashboard for EMMA. 
=========

Uses:
- Twitter Bootstrap 3.2.0
- Highcharts 4.0.4 (Needs to be in root folder and called "Highcharts") http://www.highcharts.com
- http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker/ (in root folder and called datepicker)
- uses PHP function "cal_days_in_month" so http://php.net/manual/en/book.calendar.php needs to be enabled


Notes:
- The fact that if a teacher decides to reopen a course and is able to see, for example enrollments from last year, is not a bug. It is a feature ;)
- See (emma-dash/statement_structures.json) for example statement strucure
